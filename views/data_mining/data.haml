      All data mining must begin at the same point: data. Just like any “mining” procedure, you first need a mine. However, unlike typical mining in rocks, we, or other humans, are the creators of this data. This data comes with specific data-set  and attribute types, and will usually be in one of a few commonly excepted formats. Since we are the creators of our data, any impurities, inconsistencies, or general errors that are in are data-sets are often our fault. Sometimes directly, and sometimes indirectly as the result of poor planning, and poor data gathering procedures. Most of the time however, even when necessary precautions are taken, data will be “imperfect”. The first step to data mining is the understanding of these common imperfections, and how they should best be handled. Data mining is all about finding patterns, but finding different patterns require different algorithms. Since these algorithms are not always immediately known, it is important to first look at summary statistics. It may also be important to look at a visual representation of the data, as it may be easier to locate patterns in images versus tables of numbers. The visualization, however, is often more relevant after the mining process, to illustrate the patterns found in the data. In the following paragraphs, I will further explain these fundamental aspects of data, and data quality, which are the foundations of data mining.

      Data can come in many forms, and thus there are multiple types of data-sets to handle different types and domains of data. Three common types of data are record, graph-based, and sequential data. In a record based data-set, each individual data instance represents a record. For example, this could be a record of things purchased, or a record made up of biographical information in a human resources databases. The prevalence of relational databases makes record data very familiar to us. In a relational database, each row of a table could be considered a record, and thus the data stored in such databases is often record-based data. Another common type of data is graph-based data, which is great for displaying data objects with structure. As Tan, Steinbach, and Kumar point out, “If objects have structure, that is, the objects contain sub-objects that have relationships, then such objects are frequently represented as graphs.”

      Graph-based data is also relational, or at least associative, and associations are represented as edges between nodes in the graph. For example, a data-set of airports would want to keep track of the distance, and time it took to fly from one airport to any other destination in the network. These associations would be represented as edges that were weighted according to this time and distance. Finally, data that is captured over time is a great example of the third type of data, sequential data. Sequential data happens in sequence, so it is important to maintain the order of the data. For example, time-based data may be stored in a linked list, or in a relational database with a time stamp associated with each recorded data instance. With this type of data, temporal correlation needs to be taken into account. For example, if two items are really similar, but they happened only 1 second apart, that it probably not a meaningful clustering. Data-sets are made up of attributes, of which there are also many types. Attributes can be nominal, ordinal, an interval, or a ratio. Attributes explain different things, and may be either qualitative or quantitative. They can also be discrete or continuous. If an attribute is in the set of all real numbers, it is continuous. If an attribute has a “finite or countably infinite set of values”
      %sup
        %a{:href => '#3'} 3
      , it is discrete. Because of all these different data-sets, consisting of different types of data and attributes, it is important to know your data and pick appropriate data mining methods and metrics.

      While understanding the type of data you are working with and mining it using appropriate methods will generate better results, the quality of your results will always be influenced by the quality of the data you start with. High data quality means data that is free of measurement and data collection errors. It means data that is not missing data, does not contain much noise, artifacts, or duplicates. It may also mean data free or outliers, although is some cases like network intrusion detection, outliers are actually an important part of the data. If you are collecting data, it is very important to make concerted efforts to maintain a high data quality. This is especially important when collecting human-generated data. When collecting data from humans, it is paramount to instill trust in the participants. Follett and Holm emphasize that good data collection must “establish trust with the respondents and indicate that this was a legitimate survey, not a phishing expedition.”

        %a{:href => '#2'} 2
      If trust is not established with the respondent, their answers will not be reliable. It is also important to adequately persuade a respondent to participate in a study, without being persuasive

      the study, as that may effect responses. As Follett and Holm point out, “You can't use persuasive techniques during the act of data collection, but you
      %em do
      need to persuade your respondents to participate in the first place.”
      %sup
        %a{:href => '#2'} 2
      A good way to make respondents want to participate in the first place is to not ask too much of them. Steve Krug emphasizes the importance of not making respondents have to think to much
      %sup
        %a{:href => '#1'} 1
      , while Follet and Holm remind data collectors not to “ask the user to do what you can do—or discover—on your own.”
      %sup
        %a{:href => '#2'} 2
      In other words, make surveys short and simple to ensure that respondents will be willing to both start and finish them.

      Unfortunately, however, data miners usually do not have the luxury of collecting their own data. Furthermore, the data collected for a study is often collected from other collection efforts that did not have the current study in mind. Therefore, data will inevitably be imperfect, which is what leads Tan, Steinbach, and Kumar to conclude that “Data is of high quality if it is suitable of its intended use.”
      %sup
        %a{:href => '#3'} 3
      There are many ways you can massage, or fix data, to make it suitable for your intended use. Missing data can be ignored, replaced with the mean or median for that field, or records with missing fields can be omitted. Duplicates can be parsed out and deleted from the set. Different mining techniques and algorithms are more or less susceptible to noise and artifacts, so if your data is rife with these, close attention must be paid to the selection of an algorithm. As is usually the case in data mining, the selection of algorithms and pruning techniques to make data suitable for it's intended use will require knowledge of the data, the problems with it's quality, and often knowledge of it's domain.

      Since knowing your data is so important in order to set up your mining operation, it is essential to explore the data before mining it. Exploring the data could be as simple as looking over the Excel spreadsheet or CSV file it came in, however such a simple approach is only practical with small data-sets. With larger data-sets, it is important to extract summary statistics from the data. These include minimum and maximum values, mean value, median value, standard deviation, variance, and the sum of values for each field in your data-set. Most widely available data mining tools, such as Weka or Knime, have this functionality built in and make it easy to explore your data.

      If your data-set is large, however, looking at a bunch of numbers may not be helpful in deciphering patterns. The human eye is much more used to finding visual patterns in images, which is why visualization, both in the exploration stage, and in the display of results, is another very important aspect to data-mining. Data is often easily represented in a graph, such as the summary statistics shown above in the screenshot from Weka. This is a good example of using data visualization in the exploration phase. Data can be represented in many other ways besides graphs, and a good visualization can often demonstrate a pattern found in data much faster than words. For example, look at the image below I generated from a Java-based data visualization tool called Processing. This image took input data from 225 people submitting random numbers in response to a twitter post. By laying out the numbers in a grid, and coloring them based on their frequency, a few patterns become immediately apparent.

      Look at the column of numbers containing a 7 in the ones place. From this pattern, one could guess that the top 10 “random” numbers between 1 and 99 that people tend to “generate” all have a 7 in the ones place. Perhaps its the effect of the probability of getting 7 with a pair of 6 sided dice, but there is clearly some subconscious preference for the number 7. This pattern is immediately noticeable when displayed in this manner, while it may have been missed in a table of numbers, or slightly less noticeable in a bar graph. Furthermore, this visualization can be understood just as easy by a layperson as by the data miner. This highlights the importance of data visualization. Visualization makes patterns discovered through data mining easier to discover and understand for people of all technical and mathematical backgrounds.

      I hope this exposition shined some light on the many interesting factors that go into successfully mining data for interesting patterns. There are many types of data, and data-sets will include different attributes. Understanding your data, it's domain, and composition of the data-set is essential for picking appropriate data-mining techniques. Data quality is often the most important factor to determining accurate and useful results. Sometimes we get to collect our own data, and in those cases we should follow certain guidelines to assure accurate and complete data collection, particularly when gathering human-generated data. Unfortunately, we don't always get the luxury of personally collecting the data we wish to mine. In these cases, it is important to prune and massage the data to assure accurate results. Just like picking the right data-mining techniques and algorithms, pruning again requires knowledge of the data-set to understand which techniques will work best. Successful data mining mandates a good understanding of the data-set, which is why every mining operation should begin with an exploration of the data. In conclusion, high quality and properly understood data is the foundation upon which all successful data mining stands.
